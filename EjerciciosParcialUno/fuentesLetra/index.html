    <p class="primero">Love doesn't discriminate
    Between the sinners
    And the saints
    It takes and it takes and it takes
    And we keep loving anyway.
    We laugh and we cry and we break
    And we make our mistakes.
    And if there's a reason I'm by her side
    When so many have tried
    Then I'm willing to wait for it.
    I'm willing to wait for it.

    <p class="segundo">My grandfather
    Was a fire and brimstone
    preacher, Preacher, preacher, preacher
    But there are things that the homilies and hymns
    Won't teach ya. Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya</p>
    <h3 class="tercero">My mother was a genius, Genius
    My father commanded respect. Respect, respect
    When they died they left no instructions.
    Just a legacy to protect.
    Death doesn't discriminate
    Between the sinners and the saints
    It takes and it takes and it takes
    And we keep living anyway.
    We rise and we fall and we break
    And we make our mistakes.
    And if there's a reason I'm still alive
    When everyone who loves me has died</h3>
    <h4 class="cuarto">I'm willing to wait for it.
    I'm willing to wait for it.
    Wait for it Wait for it
    Wait for it Wait for it
    I am the one thing in life I can control
    Wait for it Wait for it
    Wait for it Wait for it
    I am inimitable I am an original
    Wait for it Wait for it
    Wait for it Wait for it
    I'm not falling behind or running late
    Wait for it Wait for it
    Wait for it Wait for it
    I'm not standing still
    I am lying in wait Wait
    Wait Wait</h4>
